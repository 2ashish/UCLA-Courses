# Pipe Up

  

Low level code to perform pipe $|$ operator in shell. 

  

## Building

  

After making any required changes in **pipe.c** we need to make executable using,
>`make`

  

## Running

  

An example run can be done by running the executable using following command,
>`./pipe ls cat wc`

It will print the same output as given by running thee command `ls | cat | wc` in the shell.

  

## Cleaning up

  

To clean up, we just need to run 
>`make clean` 

It will remove all binary files created.
